# ðŸŽ“ Student Management System (SMSS)

A **Spring Boot Microservices Project** that efficiently manages student data and administrative operations for educational institutions.  
This project focuses on **clean architecture, modular microservices, RESTful APIs, and database persistence** using **Spring Boot, JPA, and Maven** â€” without Spring Security for simplicity.

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

The **Student Management System (SMSS)** automates common academic management tasks such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting student records.  
It consists of **two independent microservices** â€” one for **Admin** operations and another for **Student** management â€” which communicate via REST APIs.

This structure ensures scalability, modularity, and clarity in backend development.
