# 🎓 Student & Enrollment Management System (APC-7923)

A **Spring Boot Microservices Project** that manages student information and course enrollments through a modular, service-oriented architecture.  
This project demonstrates **microservices communication, RESTful APIs, Feign clients, and database persistence** using **Spring Boot, JDBC, and Maven**, along with a **CLI-based frontend** for easy interaction.

## 🧩 Project Overview

The **Student & Enrollment Management System (SEMS)** streamlines academic operations such as **adding, updating, deleting, and viewing student data**, as well as **managing course enrollments**.  
It is built using **two independent Spring Boot microservices** — one handling **student management** and the other managing **enrollments** — both connected through an **API Gateway** that routes and integrates service communication seamlessly.  

Additionally, a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** client provides an interactive frontend to perform all operations directly from the terminal, with formatted table outputs for a professional experience.
